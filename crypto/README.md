# Crypto
The cryptographic library for Vizard. It contains the implementation of the symmetric homomorphic stream encryption (SHSE) scheme, Distributed Point Function (DPF), Pedersen commitment, Shamirâ€™s secret sharing, and other miscellaneous cryptographic functions.

Pre-built native libraries for DPF and PRF are shipped with the source code. If you wish to build them by yourself, you can switch to the profile `compile-native-lib`:
```
mvn clean package -Pcompile-native-lib
```
